When to use branches?

Branches help you keep history organized. If there is stable build that you want to maintain while you work on the next set of significant changes, create a branch for that. You can still fix minor bugs on that branch, diff between commits, and revert to a previous version of that branch if needed.

Using branches helps you context switching between different things you are working on this project.


Visualizing with Diagrams

A diagram is constructed with commits and arrows pointing to the parent commits.
The branch label is attached to the latest commit.

It is useful to see how the branches are linked. It is also useful to see if there is any unreachable commits.
